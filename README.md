## Dark Mode Toggle

This project comes with a feature that allows users to toggle between dark and light modes.

### How It Works

- The toggle button is implemented using JavaScript and CSS.
- The user’s preference is stored in the browser’s `localStorage`, so the mode persists even after a page refresh.
- The dark mode applies a dark background and light text, improving readability in low-light conditions.

### How to Use the Toggle

1. Click the "Toggle Dark Mode" button on the top right corner of the page.
2. The theme will instantly switch, and the page will remember your preference on the next visit.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML structure of the page.
- `style.css` – Contains styles for both light and dark themes.
- `script.js` – Handles the functionality of the dark mode toggle.
- `images/` – Folder containing images used in the project.
